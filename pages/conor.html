                <h2>Conor Chepenik</h2>
                <p>Conor played football for 11 years and after graduating in 2020 he filled the empty void in his life with Bitcoin. As a soon to be father he is determined to make sure his daughter can grow up in a world where money is backed by open-source software and math rather than violence. When Conor isn't busy disrespecting the idea of central banking
                    he enjoys learning how to code, testing out new Bitcoin products (hardware & software), and playing pick-up sports.</p>
