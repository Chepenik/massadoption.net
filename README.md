Mass Adoption Website: https://massadoption.net/

Welcome to the MassAdoption github! We are both a Bitcoin meetup and an open-source project dedicated to promoting and advancing the adoption of Bitcoin worldwide. This website has been instrumental in sparking my coding journey and is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
